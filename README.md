# flower-classification
Identification of 5 different classes of flowers using CNN.
Three different approaches will be undertaken here. 

1. Train a CNN from scratch.
2. Use transfer learning(VGG16, Inception etc.)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with data augmentation.

The dataset contains 4242 images of flowers. 
The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. 
The data collection is based on the data flickr, google images, yandex images. 
You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo.
