# flower-classification
Identification of 5 different classes of flowers using CNN.
Three different approaches will be undertaken here. 

1. Train a CNN from scratch.
2. Use transfer learning(VGG16, Inception etc.)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with data augmentation.

The dataset contains 4242 images of flowers. 
The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. 
The data collection is based on the data flickr, google images, yandex images. 
You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo.
The dataset was taken from kaggle.

The data directory structure is: 

dataset/test/rose

dataset/test/tulip
